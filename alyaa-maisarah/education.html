        <h3>(2014-2018)</h3>
        <p class="inset">One of the girls' secondary school in Klang district. Looking into its history, this school has not yet been established while students need to attended nearby secondary school, <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tengku Idris Shah">SMKTIS</abbr>. Due to the amount students that to crowded in SMKTIS, the need to establish another building are need to be considered. However, since they had no budget, <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan (P) Kapar @ SMK (P) Kapar">SMK(P)K</abbr> were brought up in the project. Thus, most of the female students in SMKTIS were transfered to SMK (P) Kapar amd keep increasing as the years goes by. Since its an all-girls school, that doesn't mean they do not have some male teachers. I started attended this school from 2014 until 2018 and I took Account stream classes (consists of Account, Economy and Business subject) during 2017 to 2018.</p>
